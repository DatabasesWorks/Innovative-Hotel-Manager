Innovative Hotel Management
*********************************************************
*********************************************************
Download the file 'innovative-build-ubuntu' and run it using x-application on Linux.

And if you want to build it from source, you can do so by pulling the repo, navigating to the directory containing the file 'innovative.pro' and running the following one-by-one on a terminal:

qmake -project
qmake innovative.pro
make

You need qmake to build it, though... :(
Check if you got it by typing:
qmake -v
Install qmake before trying to build it.
*********************************************************
You can run the application by typing:

innovative (on Windows)
./innovative (on Linux)
open innovative.app (on Mac)

*********************************************************
Be warned, the app is still in alpha.
