Innovative Hotel Management
*********************************************************
*********************************************************
You can build this application from source, by pulling this repo, navigating to the directory containing the file 'innovative.pro' and running the following one-by-one on a terminal:

qmake -project
qmake innovative.pro
make

You need qmake to build it, though... :(
Check if you have it by typing:
qmake -v
Install qmake before trying to build it.

Although this app is fit for use, I am holding the release of a binary until a few more features are added.
*********************************************************
You can run the application by typing:

innovative (on Windows)
./innovative (on Linux)
open innovative.app (on Mac)

Using the application is pretty straight forward. Follow the steps one-by-one and you are good to go.

Remember these is just a suggested method. You can use it any way you want, it won't matter.

1. Add room categories first. Examples of categories are: AC Single, AC Double, etc.
2. Add room numbers to categories. The room numbers are, obviously, numbers. Use positive integers like a hotel should.

Once the room categories and room numbers are set, you are ready to check-in guests into an empty room.

You won't be able to delete that room or the room category to which the guest is checked in until he/she checks out. Neither can you check in other guest while the room is occupied.

3. Add items to the restaurant menu, if applicable.

If any checked in guest orders something, you can add the item's bill to his total bill by:

4. If he orders an item from restaurant, add it by selecting 'Add Restaurant Orders'. You can add any other order by selecting 'Add Other Orders'

5. You can check any checked in guest's billing details by going to 'Active Billing'. You can also add payments made by the guest by selecting add-payment.

6. Check-out any guest by going to 'Guest Check-out'. The guest can be checked out if all his payments are made. You view total bill and balance in the check-out form itself. You can also clear any pending payment, if applicable, and then check-out the guest. Once the guest checks out, the room becomes available for further check-in.
